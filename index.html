        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My name is Vedanshee Wadhawan

            I have several hobbies which include, singing, reading, coding and writing. Sometimes you can even include baking because I enjoy it very much. However out of all these the one that stands out to me is surely singing. Or i'd rather say Indian classical music!<br><br>

            I learn music from my guru Ruchi ma'am. It has been about 3-4 years since I am learning from her. She is the sweetest teacher I have ever met. She has helped me very much with my music journey till date. I know different ragas which include- yaman, khamaj, bhairav, bhimpalasi, malkauns, alheiya bilaval etc.<br><br>Today I can comfortably do a lot of ragas and alankars. I can play the harmonium and synthesizer very well and am able to recognize all the shudh, komal and tivra swars in all octaves (saptak). I even have started tabla recently and I am sure I will be comfortable with it too very soon.<br><br>

            I do like bollywood music and can sing a bit too however what interests me is classical. My music jourey till today has been outstanding and I expect it to be the same going ahead too. I am very excited for my journey ahead in music.

        <h1>Knowledge</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I am always happy to sare the knowledge I have with others so here is some for you......
            <br>
            <br>
            The knowledge I am sharing is about my favourite Raga which is khamaj.
            <br>'<br>
            Khamaj is one of the ten Thaats (parent scales) of Hindustani music. It is also a specific raga within the 
            <br>
            <br>
            Aaroh (asscending order of swaras)- S G M P D N S
            <br>
            <br>
            Avroh (desscending order of swaras)- S N D P M G R S
            The Nishad is komal in the avroh. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Pakad (The part in a raga which helps you recognize it without anyone telling you it's name)-N D, M P D, M G 
            The Nishad is also Komal in the Pakad
            <br>
            <br>
            All ragas have more than 2 different Bandish and Swar Malika. I have shared 1 bandish and 1 Swar malika. 
            Each swar malika is divided into 2 parts- Sthai and Antra. Sthai comes first and Antra comes second.
            <br>
            <br>
            Swar Malika
            <br>
            <br>
            Sthai
            <br>
            <br>
